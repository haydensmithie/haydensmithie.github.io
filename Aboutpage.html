				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Kiaora my name is Hayden Smith and Im a Filmmaker and a Photographer from Wellington New Zealand. I have always been passionate about capturing images and have been interested in telling storys for a while. I have run multiple youtube channels creating content for certain genres and topics and have recently since 2014 entered video competitions. I have won the Porirua short film competition, Te aro piko pathway video competition earning $2000 dollars worth of video equiptment for my school and have recently entered into other competitions for New Zealand students. Some questions I get is what camera gear did you use to film this, my main camera is the Canon EOS 600d which record 1920 by 1080 in 25 fps. My other backup camera is a good old GoPro Hero 3+ black edition and I still have my first camera a Olympus point and shoot from 2006. Cheers - Hayden Smith</p>
